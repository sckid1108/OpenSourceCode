# Open Source Code
Open Source C/C++/Verilog Code for Embedded Projects
Please feel free to use and/or copy these files.  I tried to make them as 
self contained as possible.  Maybe overtime I will unify the architecture a 
bit.  I tend to prefer C++ for embedded development these days since it makes
organizing your code simpler.

<ul>
<li>Drivers - Mixture of various C/C++ Drivers for Peripherals using I2C or SPI for communications.</li>
<li>Verilog - Bits and pieces of Verilog code to make larger building blocks from.</li>
</ul>
